This is Terminal notes vault with tagging projects in this we have  make the developer easy to make notes in the terminal with tags and keywords while using any code editor

# Terminal Notes Vault

A secure, terminal-based vault for storing notes and passwords with tagging support.
This project demonstrates secure coding practices using only Python standard libraries.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Uses PBKDF2 for key derivation and a demo XOR-based stream cipher (for demonstration purposes).
- **Tagging**: Organize entries with tags.
- **Batch Mode**: Import and check entries from CSV files.
- **Security Controls**:
    - Secure input masking.
    - Audit logging with redaction.
    - Brute-force protection (lockout after 3 failed attempts).
    - Password strength estimation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Install as a Package

```bash
    pip install terminal-vault
    ```


## Usage

### Initialize Vault
```bash
vault init
```

### Add Entry
```bash
vault add --title "My Secret" --tags "personal,finance"
```

### Retrieve Entries
```bash
vault get --tag "personal"
vault get --search "Secret"
```

### Batch Check
```bash
vault check entries.csv
```

### Generate Report
```bash
vault report
```

## Security Boundaries (Demo Scope)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Encryption**: This tool uses a **demonstration encryption scheme** (XOR stream cipher) because the requirements restricted usage to Python Standard Libraries only (no `cryptography` or `PyCryptodome`). **DO NOT USE FOR HIGH-VALUE SECRETS IN PRODUCTION.**

- **Key Derivation**: Uses `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac` with SHA-256 and 100,000 iterations.
- **Memory Safety**: Python strings are immutable, so secrets may persist in memory until garbage collected.
- **Side Channels**: No specific protection against timing attacks or power analysis.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
- `vault.log`: Audit log (redacted).
- `.vault_lockout`: Lockout state file.
